<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
All you need is an account at ING, and a phone with the Bluecoins app.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo (or download it)
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/elioverhoef/ING_Bluecoins.git
   ```
2. Download a CSV file of all your transactions from ING. Make sure you choose the option where the CSV file is separated by the character ';'.
3. Place the file in the same folder as 'Convert.exe' from the repo.
4. Run 'Convert.exe'. This will generate the output.csv file.
5. Copy the output.csv file to your phone, and import it in the data settings of the Bluecoins app.

Now all your transactions are imported to Bluecoins!
